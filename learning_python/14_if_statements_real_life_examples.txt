#Use of if statements in real life. Literally. 

I wake up
If I'm hungry #this is a condition -it's gonna be either True or False
    I eat breakfast

I leave my house 
if it's cloudy #this one has two different conditions. if the condition is false we have another thing to do.
    I bring an umbrella
otherwise
    I bring sunglasses

I'm at a restaurant #this one is even more complex. if the condition is false we have other conditions to check from the statements.
if I want meat
    I order a steak
otherwise if I want pasta
    I order spaghetti & meatballs
otherwise
    I order a salad
